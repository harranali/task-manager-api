# ✅ Task Manager API in Go
A simple and lightweight Task Manager API written in Go. This project uses an in-memory database and is structured using a feature-based architecture. It is ideal for learning purposes and rapid prototyping of RESTful services in Go.

## ✨ Features

- 🗂️ Task management with basic CRUD operations (extendable)
- 🏗️ Feature-based project structure for scalability
- 🔐 User authentication using JWT
- 🌐 HTTP server built with Go's standard `net/http` package
- 💾 In-memory data storage
